DISCORD MOVIE BOT

    This is my first attempt at a discord movie bot,
    I want the bot to be able to look at a channel,
    read the movies that are suggested within, and
    then plug those suggestions into a database (sql)
    that when the bot is called through a ! command
    it will spit out a random movie choice.

Steps to take:
    
1: ~~Create SQL Database~~ 

2: ~~Create test discord~~

3: Write connection bot in python
