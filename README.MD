DISCORD MOVIE BOT

    This is my first attempt at a discord movie bot,
    I want the bot to be able to look at a channel,
    read the movies that are suggested within, and
    then plug those suggestions into a database (sqlite)
    that when the bot is called through a ! command
    it will spit out a random movie choice. 
    The bot should also check for duplicate movies and not submit them.
